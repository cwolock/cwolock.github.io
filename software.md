## Sofware packages

I am dedicated to developing usable statistical software. I've created or contributed to the following R packages. 

* `survML`: Tools for flexible survival analysis using machine learning (`cre`, `aut`). ([website](https://github.com/cwolock/survML))

* `SimEngine`: Framework for reproducible statistical simulations in R (`aut`). ([website](https://github.com/Avi-Kenny/SimEngine))

* `rigr`: Regression, inference, and general data analysis tools for R (`aut`). ([website](https://github.com/statdivlab/rigr))

* `vimp`: Inference on algorithm-agnostic variable importance (`ctb`). ([website](https://github.com/bdwilliamson/vimp))
