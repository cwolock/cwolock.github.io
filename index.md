Welcome to my research page! I'm a PhD student in Biostatistics at the [University of Washington](http://biostat.washington.edu/).

Before joining UW Biostatistics, I studied Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at [Harvard University](http://oeb.harvard.edu/), with a language citation in Spanish. I was a research associate at the [Institute for Genomic Medicine](http://igm.columbia.edu) at Columbia University.

I currently work with [Dr. Lurdes Inoue](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/lurdes-inoue), exploring the connections between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to dynamic treatment regimes. My collaborative projects include work with [Dr. Bruce Weir](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/bruce-weir) and [Dr. Sam Wasser](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/samuel-k-wasser), adapting forensic genetic techniques to combat elephant poaching. My research is supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
